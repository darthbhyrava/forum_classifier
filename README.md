## Health Forum Message Classification

### Problem Statement

Online health forum discussions are becoming first stop for patient or their relatives to seek advice on health related issues. Because of their free nature, administering these discussions require lots of manual effort. In this project, we utilize deep learning technique to classify online health discussion forum posts into one of the following 7 categories:

1. Demographic (DEMO): Forums targeted towards specific demographic sub-groups characterized by age, gender, profession, ethnicity, etc.
2. Disease (DISE): Forums related to a specific disease
3. Treatment (TRMT): Forums related to a specific treatment or procedure
4. Goal-oriented (GOAL): Forums related to achieving a health goal, such as weight management, exercise regimen, etc.
5. Pregnancy (PREG): Forums related to pregnancy, including forums on difficulties with conception and concerns about mother and unborn childâ€™s heath during pregnancy
6. Family support (FMLY): Forums related to issues of a caregiver (rather than a patient), such with support of an ill child or spouse.
7. Socializing (SOCL): Forums related to socializing, including hobbies and recreational activities, rather than a specific health-related issue.
